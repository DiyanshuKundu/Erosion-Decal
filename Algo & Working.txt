Algorithm :
---------------

1. Setting up Parameters :
	
	Set up the following parameters:
	Size: Define the dimensions (width, height) of the erosion decal image.
	Edge Sharpness: Affects how sharp the edges of the decal will be.
	Noise Scale: Controls the detail level in the Perlin noise.
	Noise Strength: Determines how much the Perlin noise will influence the final decal.

2. Generating Perlin Noise Grid :

	Create a grid (2D array) with dimensions equal to the specified size.
	For each position (x, y) in this grid:
	Set the initial noise value to 0.
	Define two lists:
		-Scales: A list of different scale factors to capture different levels of detail. Each scale 				defines how "zoomed in" a noise layer will be.
		-Strengths: Corresponding strength values for each scale factor to blend multiple layers of noise.
	Loop through each combination of scale and strength values:
		Generate a noise value for (x, y) using the Perlin noise function:
			- Scale the x and y coordinates by dividing them by (scale * s), where s is the current 			  scale factor.
			- Calculate the Perlin noise value at this position using the scaled coordinates.
		Multiply the noise value by the strength and add it to the total noise value n.
	After looping through all scales, divide n by the number of scales to get an average noise value.
	Store the averaged noise value in the grid at position (x, y).

3. Normalizing the Noise Grid :
	
	Once the noise values are stored in the grid:
	Find the minimum and maximum values in the grid.
	For each value in the grid, normalize it to fall between 0 and 1:
	Subtract the minimum value from each noise value.
	Divide the result by the range (maximum - minimum).

4. Creating the Base Shape :
	
	Define a base circular shape for the decal:
		For each position (x, y) in the grid:
			- Calculate the distance from the center of the image to (x, y).
			- Invert the distance to make the center higher (1) and edges lower (0).
	Apply an edge sharpness factor to this base shape by raising each value to the power of the edge_sharpness 	parameter.
	This produces a sharp-edged, circular shape centered on the grid.

5. Generating and Blending the Perlin Noise with the Base Shape :

	Generate Perlin noise for the grid with the specified noise_scale.
	Normalize the Perlin noise values to fall between 0 and 1.
	Set a threshold value (e.g., 0.57):
		For each value in the noise grid:
			If the noise value is greater than the threshold, set it to 1.
			If it is less than the threshold, set it to 0.
	This step converts the noise into a binary pattern, creating distinct areas of "erosion."

6. Displaying the result :
	
	Plot the final grid as a grayscale image and also the normalized map to visualize the erosion decal.
